# Mulle Template Documentation Process Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the systematic process for creating comprehensive command documentation for mulle-template. Based on practical experience with documentation creation, it provides clear guidelines for what to write, what to avoid, and the step-by-step process to follow.

## 🚨🚨🚨 CRITICAL WARNING: SOURCE CODE ANALYSIS IS MANDATORY 🚨🚨🚨

**DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT READING THE SOURCE CODE FIRST**

Previous documentation attempts failed because creators relied on checklists and help output instead of examining the actual source code. This resulted in **missing 40+ commands** that were never documented.

**Every command in the main script's dispatch logic MUST be documented.** Skipping this step will result in incomplete and inaccurate documentation that misleads users.

**If you are not willing to read the source code, STOP NOW and ask for help.** Incomplete documentation is worse than no documentation.

## 🔥 ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN: DO NOT USE EXISTING DOCUMENTATION AS REFERENCE 🔥

**DO NOT copy from existing documentation files.** They may contain fantasy content not based on actual source code analysis. Each documentation file must be created by analyzing the actual source code implementation.

**Point in case: `desecrate.md` contains fantasy documentation** - it was made up rather than based on actual source code analysis. This is unacceptable and misleading to users.

## Documentation Creation Process

### Phase 1: Command Analysis

#### Step 1: Gather Command Information
- **MANDATORY: Analyze the main script's main function directly** - Open the main script file (typically `{TOOL_NAME}/{TOOL_NAME}`) and examine the `{TOOL_NAME}::main()` function's case statement to extract ALL available commands
- **CRITICAL: Do NOT rely on checklists or assumptions** - The source code is the authoritative source of truth for available commands
- **REQUIRED: Document every case value** - Each `case` statement in the main dispatch logic represents a command that must be documented
- **MANDATORY: Include hidden/utility commands** - Commands like `libexec-dir`, `uname`, `version`, etc. are often overlooked but must be documented
- **Identify command categories** (generation, analysis, system, utility)
- **Note command relationships** and dependencies between commands
- **Document command aliases** and shortcuts

#### Step 2: Analyze Command Behavior
- **Examine visible options** using `--help` output
- **Identify hidden options** through source code analysis
- **Understand conditional behaviors** and option interactions
- **Document scope and persistence** of command effects

#### Step 3: Map Command Ecosystem
- **Create command dependency graph** showing relationships
- **Identify command workflows** and typical usage patterns
- **Document integration points** with other commands
- **Note cross-command data flow** and shared state

### Phase 2: Documentation Structure

#### Required Sections (Always Include)

**Header and Quick Start**
- Command name and brief description
- Basic usage syntax
- Most common use case example

**Options Documentation**
- All visible options with descriptions
- Hidden/advanced options (clearly marked)
- Option syntax and parameter requirements
- Default values and behaviors

**Practical Examples**
- Basic usage scenarios
- Advanced configuration examples
- Integration with other commands
- Real-world workflow patterns

**Troubleshooting**
- Common error conditions
- Recovery procedures
- Diagnostic commands
- Prevention strategies

#### Optional Sections (Include When Relevant)

**Technical Details**
- Implementation specifics (high-level only)
- File system interactions
- Environment variable effects
- Performance considerations

**Integration Examples**
- Workflow automation scripts
- CI/CD integration
- Development environment setup
- Cross-platform considerations

## What to Write (Content Guidelines)

### ✅ Include These Elements

**Clear, Actionable Examples**
```bash
# Good: Specific, runnable commands
{TOOL_NAME} <command> <arguments>
{TOOL_NAME} <command> --help
{TOOL_NAME} <command> --verbose

# Good: Workflow examples
{TOOL_NAME} <command1> <args>
{TOOL_NAME} <command2> <args>
{TOOL_NAME} <command3> <args>
```

**Comprehensive Option Coverage**

- Typical workflow sequences
- Environment setup patterns
- Cross-command data sharing

### ❌ Avoid These Elements

**Implementation Details**
- Internal function names or variables
- File system paths (unless user-facing)
- Low-level data structures
- Build system specifics

**Speculative Content**
- Unverified use cases
- Hypothetical scenarios
- Future feature assumptions
- Unsupported configurations

**Redundant Information**
- Repeating information from other docs
- Obvious or trivial details
- Generic help text
- Boilerplate descriptions

**Platform-Specific Details**
- OS-specific implementation differences
- Hardware-dependent behaviors
- Version-specific limitations
- Environment-specific workarounds

## Documentation Standards

### Formatting Rules

**Consistent Structure**
- Use standard section headers
- Maintain consistent indentation (3 spaces)
- Follow Allman brace style in code examples
- Use columnar alignment for option tables

**Code Example Standards**
- Include realistic, runnable commands
- Use meaningful variable names
- Show both success and error cases
- Provide context for complex examples

**Cross-Reference System**
- Link to related commands using `[command](command.md)` syntax
- Reference external documentation when appropriate
- Maintain consistent link formatting
- Update references when commands are renamed

### Quality Assurance

**Accuracy Checks**
- Verify all commands work as documented
- Test examples on clean environment
- Confirm option behaviors match implementation
- Validate troubleshooting steps

**Completeness Review**
- Ensure all visible options are documented
- Check for missing error conditions
- Verify integration examples work
- Confirm cross-references are valid

**Consistency Validation**
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Maintain uniform formatting
- Follow established patterns
- Check against existing documentation
